# Git workshop materials

## Building slides
The slides are built using Racket's slideshow module. You can build the slides using `make`, but you do need to change the referenced URLs in the `workshop.rkt` file to point to your own GitHub repository.

These slides also depend on [a custom fork of termshot](https://github.com/ColonelPhantom/termshot).

If you just want to view the slides, I will upload a copy of the PDF under ["releases"](https://github.com/ColonelPhantom/git-workshop/releases) if/when I give a workshop with changed slides.
